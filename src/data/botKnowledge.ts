Who We Are:
DigiSwasthya Foundation is a technology-enabled healthcare organization committed to making quality healthcare accessible, affordable, and inclusive for underserved communities across India. By combining digital healthcare, expert medical professionals, and community outreach initiatives, DigiSwasthya works to bridge the gap between healthcare services and the people who need them the most.

The Healthcare Challenge in India:
Rural and underserved communities face: shortage of specialist doctors, delayed diagnosis, limited healthcare infrastructure, financial constraints, and low health awareness.

Why DigiSwasthya Exists:
DigiSwasthya was established to reduce the gap between healthcare providers and underserved communities through technology-driven solutions, medical expertise, health camps, preventive screening programs, and awareness initiatives.

Mission: To make quality healthcare accessible to every individual by leveraging technology, medical expertise, preventive care, and community-driven healthcare initiatives that improve health outcomes and promote well-being.
Vision: To build a healthier and more inclusive India where every individual, regardless of geography or financial background, has access to timely, affordable, and quality healthcare.

Founder's Story (Sandeep Kumar):
In 2007, Sandeep Kumar was unwell and wandered from hospital to hospital in Sant Kabir Nagar, Uttar Pradesh, unable to get a correct diagnosis due to lack of qualified doctors. After 6 months, he was diagnosed with Ewing Sarcoma (a type of bone cancer) and his entire right humerus bone was replaced. Doctors said further delay would have left him immobilized. He recovered at Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai.
From 2015–2020, he dedicated himself to supporting cancer patients and survivors. In July 2020, he invested his savings to establish DigiSwasthya's first telemedicine clinic in his home district (Sant Kabir Nagar), creating one of the state's first hybrid medical consultation facilities. DigiSwasthya = Digi (Digital) + Swasthya (Health).

Certifications: Great Place to Work Certified (August 2023 – August 2024), Non-profit & Charity Organizations category.

How We Work — 8 Pillars:
1. Awareness Campaigns — Community outreach and health education in rural areas.
2. Accurate Information — Trained coordinators provide reliable health guidance.
3. Electronic Medical Records (EMR) — Digital patient records for continuity of care.
4. Primary Health Checkups — Basic assessments at village centers to detect early symptoms.
5. Expert Doctor Consultation — Teleconsultation video links with specialist city doctors.
6. Timely Diagnosis — Faster access to professional consultation to reduce delays.
7. Referral Pathways — Guidance to partner hospitals for advanced treatment.
8. Follow-Ups — Digital tracking and routine check-ins for chronic disease management.

Care Model Principles:
- Bringing Healthcare Closer to Communities: Trained coordinator welcomes patient, records vitals, connects with a doctor over live video, issues digital prescription, with no need to travel far.
- Delivering Better Care Through Technology: AI assists doctors to review patient history; clinical judgement is never replaced.
- Caring Beyond a Single Consultation: Chronic disease patients (diabetes, hypertension) receive ongoing care and follow-ups.
- Understanding the Whole Person: Model considers family history, nutrition, water & sanitation.
- Built for Rural India: Works offline in low-connectivity areas; syncs when back online. Runs in English and Hindi on Android devices.
- Protecting Every Patient's Trust: Patient data is encrypted and accessible only to authorized healthcare staff.
- Scaling Quality Healthcare: Every improvement rolls out to all centres, ensuring consistent care.
